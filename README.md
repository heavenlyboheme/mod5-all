# mod5-all

The back end is nearly done, but the front end is unavailable due to issues with permissions. Apparently I do not have permissions to install create-react-app, and am unable to execute the command on the command line. I am able to add the gem react-rails to the gemfile, but cannot execute it in command line either.

I have used sudo, and all of the other stack overflow solutions from others who were having the same issue. I wonder if this is an issue due to me having a student computer. In any case, I have done create-react-app before and react-rails gem, and this is the first time I have not been able.

I have attached the screenshot of the error in the images folder attached under the back end called "youth-dir." One screenshot is of the error and one screenshot is of the data that was rendered upon starting the server. I've done associations and routes for the resources and all I have left is to create a foreign key under the Member model via AddGroupToMembers and the only thing I intended to do was add a form on the front end to add members to groups and index the directory of groups.
